# TinyVGG fashionMNIST classification
A neural network based on tiny VGG architecture to classify the fashionMNIST dataset.

For this issue, the dataset available in the link below has been used. [Click here! ](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)  (After running the code, the dataset files are automatically downloaded and stored in the local system.)
Run the Main.py file to run the code. After running the code, you will need to specify the following:

* The number of iteration steps (Epochs)
* Learning rate
* Batch size
* Optimizer model

After running the code with a learning rate of 0.003, the number of epochs of 15 and the Adam optimizer, the following graphs and accuracies have been obtained.

Accuracies:
